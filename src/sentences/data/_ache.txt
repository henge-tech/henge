I have an ache in my back from sleeping on the hard ground, but luckily I brought my Apache sleeping bag to attach to my pack for extra padding.

I woke up with a terrible backache and a bellyache this morning, and I can't find my cache of headache medicine anywhere.

My earache was so painful that I couldn't concentrate on painting with my gouache set, and the thought of my recent heartache only made it worse.

I bought a pair of colorful huarache sandals to wear to the beach, and paired them with my favorite mustache T-shirt for a touch of panache.
