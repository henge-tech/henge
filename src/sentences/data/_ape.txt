The ape wore a cape while displaying agape love for all those around it.

The curtains were draped with crape fabric, and the window gaped open.

She gently ran her fingers through her hair, smoothing down the nape of her neck as she tried to reshape her curls. Outside, the landscape was constantly changing as the earth shifted and scaped the land.

The boat was in shipshape condition, despite the scrape on its hull from the rocky seascape.
