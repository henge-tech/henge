While out afoot, I spied a coot sitting on the bank of a small pond, eating a beetroot and smoking a cheroot.

After a long hoot from an owl in the night, I followed a path leading to a clearing where a moot was taking place about a new offshoot of a nearby forest.

When I took the wrong turn and overshot my destination, I quickly scooted back to the correct path and noticed that strange black soot had been collecting around the taproot of a nearby tree.

As a tenderfoot explorer, I was cautious of every toot and step I took, making sure to look underfoot before uprooting any weeds in my path.
