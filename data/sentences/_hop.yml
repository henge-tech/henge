The archbishop stopped by the bakeshop to pick up a sweet treat before getting a haircut at the barbershop.

The bellhop carried the bishop's luggage up to the room, and then headed to the kitchen to chop some vegetables for dinner.

After a long day of work, the tired traveler stopped by the cookshop for a quick meal before hopping over to the pawnshop to sell his old watch.

The workers in the sweatshop toiled away for long hours, hoping to whop out as many products as possible before the end of the day, while the artists in the workshop carefully crafted their creations with care and attention to detail.
