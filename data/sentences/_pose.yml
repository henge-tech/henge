Adipose tissue is composed of numerous cells that can decompose and depose the stored energy when the body needs it.

When faced with a difficult decision, we can dispose of our old opinions, expose our minds to new ideas, impose our own beliefs, or interpose between conflicting parties.

We can juxtapose opposing arguments in order to gain a better understanding of the issue, predispose ourselves to different outcomes, and even presuppose that we know the right answer.

We should always remember that our purpose in life is to find inner peace and repose, no matter what the situation; that we can suppose the best even when things seem bleak; and that transposing our concerns into positive action can lead to true transformation.
