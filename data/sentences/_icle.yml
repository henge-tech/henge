The antiparticle of the article was discovered by the scientist as she hummed a canticle to herself.

The chronicle of the company's history was kept in a cubicle, next to the CEO's office, on a shelf above her clavicle.

As she examined the strand of hair under the microscope, she noticed that the cuticle was damaged and the follicle was clogged with icicles.

The mechanic checked the vehicle's engine and found that the ventricle had a small crack, causing the testicle to leak oil.
