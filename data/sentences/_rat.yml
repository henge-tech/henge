An autocrat is an aristocrat who rules with absolute power, much like a baccarat player calculating their odds of success and risking it all on one final hand.

The bratty bureaucrat was so obsessed with amassing wealth and power that they spent immense amounts of time, energy and money attempting to acquire large carats of diamonds and jewels, regardless of the cost.

In a democracy, every citizen has the power to decide who will rule and no one person holds autocratic power, unlike a drat who only follows orders, while karats are used to measure the purity of gold to infer its worth.

The muskrat scurried around the marsh looking for food and shelter, while the prat pranced around like they owned the land, and the sprat was content with simply swimming in the water, content and carefree.
