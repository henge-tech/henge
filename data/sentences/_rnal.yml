The eternal bond of carnal love is stronger than the diurnal passage of time, and will always remain unbroken.

The external bonds of fraternal love may appear fragile and fleeting, but its internal strength is infernal and unbreakable.

The maternal, nocturnal hours spent in the comfort of keeping a journal are moments of eternal joy and unbreakable connections.

The supernal gifts of the vernal season are reminders of the eternal power of the paternal love which binds us together.
