The classic archetype of a person has been expressed through paintings and daguerreotypes for centuries, but biotypes are more complex ways to represent someone's unique individual features.

An ecotype is an organism adapted to a particular local environment, while a genotype is an organism with a specific genetic makeup and logotypes are symbols that represent a particular organization or brand.

A monotype is a one-of-a-kind work of art, a phenotype is an organism's physical appearance and behavior, beyond its genetic makeup, and a prototype is an early sample or model of a product made for testing.

Stereotypes are oversimplified and often inaccurate ideas about a group of people, teletypes send typed messages over long distances and tintypes are photographs printed on thin sheets of iron.
