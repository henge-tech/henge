An athlete needs to use his own determination and dedication to compete on the concrete floor, but he must never deplete his energy or motivation in order to succeed.

A discrete person should never be effete in their actions, otherwise they risk having to excrete any hard work they put in to celebrate a fete.

The naivete of a gamete that carries only half the genetic material is no match for the machete wielded by fate, which will mete out its predetermined destiny.

A triathlete's success lies in their ability to replete their physical and mental stamina whilst still remaining focused and not allowing their training to become obsolete; all the hard work and dedication then eventually secrete into a rewarding outcome.
