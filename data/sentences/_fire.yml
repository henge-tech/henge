The bonfire in the backyard was afire, but it eventually backfired and the flames went out.

As the ceasefire was announced, the soldiers stopped firing their weapons and the crossfire ceased, but the foxfire continued to burn in the forest.

The gunfire echoed through the streets as the soldiers battled fiercely, their weapons spitting hellfire at their enemies. However, some of the guns misfired, causing confusion and chaos on the battlefield.

The spitfire dragon breathed a stream of flames, causing the grass to catch fire and spread in a surefire wildfire that burned through the entire field.
