I tried to climb up the beanstalk, but every time I tried, I would get scared and balk, and my sister would just roll her eyes and backtalk me.

I strolled down the boardwalk, enjoying the warm sun on my face and the sound of the waves crashing against the shore. It was such a cakewalk, I barely broke a sweat. Later that evening, I headed to the fashion show and watched the models strut their stuff on the catwalk.

As I walked across the crosswalk on my way to school, I couldn't help but notice the beautiful chalk art on the sidewalk. It was such a bright and cheerful scene, it made me feel happy just looking at it. Suddenly, I heard a loud voice behind me, and when I turned around, I saw two people deep in crosstalk, completely unaware of their surroundings.

As I walked home from the grocery store, I couldn't help but notice the full moon in the sky. It was so bright and beautiful, it seemed to be following me as I made my way down the sidewalk. I tried to moonwalk for a bit, just for fun, but I ended up tripping and almost falling on the stalk of a weed that had grown up through a crack in the pavement.
