The bwana wearing a bright yellow bandana was eating a banana while sitting on the beach.

After winning the gymkhana, the rider took his prize iguana to the cabana by the beach to relax.

The liana vines growing around the manana tree were used by the villagers to make baskets, while the leaves of the marijuana plant were used for medicinal and recreational purposes.

The yogi reached a state of nirvana through the practice of prana control and the consumption of a dried sultana during meditation.
