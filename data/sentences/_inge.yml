While I was binge-watching an old sitcom, I cringed as I saw an outrageous fringe of bangs on one of the characters--it was truly a fashion crime!

When the door opened on its rusty old hinge, I could feel the gust of wind impinging upon my face and infringing on my personal space.

When I touched the hot pan, I felt the singe of heat and quickly grabbed the syringe filled with cold water to try and diminish the tinge of pain.
