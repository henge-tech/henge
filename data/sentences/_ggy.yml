The old, baggy jeans hung on the craggy rock as she waded through the boggy marsh in her trusty, old buggy.

The doggy wandered aimlessly through the foggy, misty forest, feeling groggy from lack of sleep and admiring the leggy trees.

The moggy lay in the sun, basking in the muggy heat and watching the piggy root around in the dirt, its saggy belly jiggling with each movement.

The scraggy, shaggy dog shook itself, sending droplets of water flying everywhere as it emerged from the soggy underbrush, its twiggy legs barely able to support its shivering body.
