An autocracy is an aristocracy ruled by one ruler with absolute power who, throughout their reign, strives for accuracy in the bureaucracy they employ to operate.

When a confederacy of people conspire together for the degeneracy and illiteracy of those less fortunate, it is an affront to justice.

A magistracy governed by a meritocracy is the best form of government, as it rewards those with merit while striving for accuracy and literacy in all aspects of its affairs.

Theocracy's principal aim is to teach numeracy and literacy, not piracy and racy behavior, as it aims for moral and ethical accuracy and consistency.
